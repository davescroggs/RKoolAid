## Tidy data

From the TidyR [CRAN:](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)

*Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data:*

*- Every column is a variable.*

*- Every row is an observation.*

*- Every cell is a single value.*
