```{r}
aoc_day1 <- readr::read_lines("data/aoc_data/aoc_day1.txt")
```

## Part 1

```{r}
tibble(reading = aoc_day1) %>% 
  mutate(diff = if_else(reading > lag(reading),"higher","lower")) %>% 
  count(diff)
```

## Part 2

```{r}
tibble(reading = aoc_day1) %>% 
  mutate(reading = as.integer(reading),
    reading = reading + lead(reading,1) + lead(reading,2),
    diff = if_else(reading > lag(reading),"higher","lower")) %>% 
  count(diff)
```
